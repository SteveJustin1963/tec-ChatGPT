# tec-MINT-2-OpenAI
python serial terminal with openAI API link, so AI can talk to MINT running on a TEC-1


The OpenAI API is a cloud-based service that allows developers to access the capabilities of the OpenAI language models, including ChatGPT. The API provides a simple interface for sending input text and receiving predicted output text in real-time. The API can be integrated into a variety of applications and services, such as chatbots, language translation systems, and more. The API offers several customization options, such as controlling the length of the output and setting specific parameters for the language model's behavior. Access to the API is typically provided through API keys and usage is charged based on the amount of API requests made.

## high-level overview of the steps required to use the OpenAI API with a serial terminal app:

Register for an OpenAI API key: You will need to create an account with OpenAI and apply for an API key to access the OpenAI API.

Choose a serial terminal app: There are several serial terminal apps available for different platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Some popular examples include PuTTY, CoolTerm, and Screen.

Connect the serial terminal app to the API: You will need to write a program or script to interface with the OpenAI API and send input text to the API and receive output text from the API. You can use a programming language such as Python or JavaScript to do this. The program or script should use the API key and send an HTTP request to the API endpoint. The output text received from the API can then be displayed in the serial terminal app.

Test the setup: Once you have the program or script set up, you can test the communication between the serial terminal app and the OpenAI API by sending input text to the API and checking the output text in the serial terminal app.

## Python script to communicate with a serial terminal at a baud rate of 4800. 
To do this, you can use a library such as pyserial that provides an interface for accessing serial ports in Python.


## combine API with a 4800 baud python serial terminal
Here is an example of a Python script that implements both step 3 from the previous answer and a 4800 baud serial terminal using the pyserial library:

```
import requests
import serial

# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Endpoint for the OpenAI API
API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-002/jobs"

def generate_text(prompt):
    # Define the request data
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 100,
        "temperature": 0.5,
    }

    # Send a post request to the API endpoint
    response = requests.post(
        API_ENDPOINT,
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
        },
        json=data,
    )

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise ValueError("Failed to generate text")

    # Return the generated text
    return response.json()["choices"][0]["text"]

# Open the serial port
ser = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=4800, timeout=1)

while True:
    # Read data from the serial port
    data = ser.readline().strip().decode("utf-8")

    # Generate text using the OpenAI API
    generated_text = generate_text(data)

    # Write the generated text to the serial port
    ser.write(generated_text.encode("utf-8"))

ser.close()
```

now openAI can talk to MINT and learn form it and code it
